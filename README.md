# GoNL Database

The `molgenis-go-nl` repository contains all of the code, data, and files used to update the GoNL MOLGENIS app. The motivation behind this was to create a semi-reproducible workflow for updating the GoNL Molgenis server. This method may be useful for developing, managing, documenting future Molgenis projects.

The GoNL vue application has been moved to [https://github.com/molgenis/projects-rd-dashboards](https://github.com/molgenis/projects-rd-dashboards).
